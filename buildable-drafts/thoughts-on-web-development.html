<p>The web development landscape in 2025 is more complex than ever. We have more frameworks, libraries, and build tools than any one person could hope to master. But is all this complexity necessary?</p>

<h2>The Complexity Trap</h2>

<p>Modern web development often feels like this: to build a simple website, you need to install 500+ npm packages, configure webpack, set up Babel, choose between React, Vue, or Angular, add TypeScript, configure ESLint and Prettier, set up a CI/CD pipeline, and... well, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong—these tools exist for good reasons. They solve real problems at scale. But somewhere along the way, we've normalized this complexity for <em>every</em> project, regardless of size or requirements.</p>

<h2>When Vanilla JavaScript Shines</h2>

<p>For many projects, vanilla JavaScript is not just sufficient—it's superior. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No build step:</strong> Edit, save, refresh. That's it. No waiting for webpack to compile.</li>
  <li><strong>No dependencies:</strong> No security vulnerabilities in outdated packages, no breaking changes, no maintenance burden.</li>
  <li><strong>Better performance:</strong> Less code means faster load times and better user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Your code will still work in 10 years without updating dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Understanding the fundamentals makes you a better developer, regardless of what framework you use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Right Tool for the Job</h2>

<p>This isn't an anti-framework rant. Frameworks are incredibly valuable for certain types of applications. If you're building a complex single-page application with real-time updates, state management, and hundreds of interactive components, reach for React or Vue.</p>

<p>But if you're building:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A blog (like this one)</li>
  <li>A portfolio site</li>
  <li>A landing page</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>A small business website</li>
</ul>

<p>...then vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript might be all you need.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Simplicity</h2>

<p>There's something deeply satisfying about building with simple tools. When you remove the layers of abstraction, you understand exactly what your code does. You're in control.</p>

<p>This blog is proof of concept. It has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dark mode with system preference detection</li>
  <li>Responsive design that works on all devices</li>
  <li>Dynamic content loading</li>
  <li>Clean, semantic HTML</li>
  <li>Fast load times</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this in a few hundred lines of code, with zero dependencies. No framework required.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Before reaching for a framework, ask yourself: "What problem am I solving?" If the answer is "everyone else uses it" or "it's industry standard," take a step back and consider whether simpler tools might suffice.</p>

<p>The best code is often the code you don't write. Choose simplicity when you can, complexity only when you must.</p>
